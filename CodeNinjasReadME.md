1.	ReadME
This is a website created for Mzamomtsha Primary School to use as they see fit.

Description
This is merely a website to give parents and sponsors of the school more information in an effort to increase the support the school is already receiving.

Visuals
Before attempting to rehost this website, first ensure that all the required images are still accessible from the folder this website uses to store its imagery. If the images are not accessible, this means that the website will have content missing and will ultimately alter the website layout displayed.

Most of the images are in the same jpg image format, these are mostly in a smaller resolution for smaller images to reduce the loading times.
Text and images are made to be responsive by changing image positioning and text font after reaching a set screenwidth.

Installation
The site will already be hosted, but if you want to change or add a new page make sure to reupload the new file to your account at netlify.com and to share the newest link with the people who need to view it. If you have your own website domain copy it. The best way to do version control of the website is to add a github Project Source Code link to your project so that you do not have to reupload the file every time. 

The images must be in the file, if not please add the images so that it can show on the webpages. In the event you do not have the images, please contact us so that we can share the files that are needed.

A short example/tutorial

How our website works:

Our website is meant for anyone from people curious as to what the school is like to potential students. It is designed to be simple to use and easy to navigate. Users are presented with 3 pages, a home page along with an about us page including school staff and the history of the school. And finally, there is an events page for students/parents as well as possible sponsors.

Users will not have to do much on their part. The aim was for anyone to be able to access the site without too much hassle. At the top of each page there will a navigation bar which will allow the user to switch between pages effortlessly. The site makes use of drop downs in order to minimise space used.

Visual Studio Code was the software that was used to create this website.

Visual Studio Code is a source-code editor developed by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. It includes embedded Git and support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, and code refactoring. It is highly customizable, allowing users to change the theme, keyboard shortcuts, preferences, and install extensions that add additional functionality. The source code is free and open-source, released under the permissive MIT License. The compiled binaries are freeware for any use.

The coding languages used to create this project was HTML, CSS and JavaScript. HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language and is used to create the structure of a Web page. HTML consists of a series of elements that are use to make this possible. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media by specifiying the font elements need to be displayed in, font-sizes, colours and etc...

JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has a curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. All three of these programming languages are made use of to create this project.

4.	Coding Conventions
-	A consistent indentation and spacing was followed.
-	The use of lowercase letters was maintained in writing of html elements.
-	Lower case letters were used to write html attributes and a mix of lowercase and uppercase letters was used in naming of values.
-	The code is separated in small different files for a readable and an easy to understand structure

6.	Licensing information
BSD Licensing
BSD licenses are a family of permissive free software licenses, imposing minimal restrictions on the use and distribution of covered software. This is in contrast to copyleft licenses, which have share-alike requirements. The original BSD license was used for its namesake, the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD), a Unix-like operating system. The original version has since been revised, and its descendants are referred to as modified BSD licenses.

BSD is both a license and a class of license (generally referred to as BSD-like). The modified BSD license (in wide use today) is very similar to the license originally used for the BSD version of Unix. The BSD license is a simple license that merely requires that all code retain the BSD license notice if redistributed in source code format, or reproduce the notice if redistributed in binary format. The BSD license (unlike some other licenses) does not require that source code be distributed at all.
